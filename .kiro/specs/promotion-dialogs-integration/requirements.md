# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating updated promotion dialogs across all chess board components in the application. Currently, only ChessTutorialBoard and ChessBattleBoard have promotion dialog functionality, but promotion can occur in other game modes as well. The goal is to ensure consistent promotion handling across all chess board components using the existing PromotionDialog component with piece images.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to see consistent promotion dialogs across all game modes, so that I have a uniform experience when promoting pawns regardless of which chess board I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pawn reaches the promotion rank in ChessPuzzleBoard THEN the system SHALL display the promotion dialog with piece images
2. WHEN a pawn reaches the promotion rank in PersonsChessBoard THEN the system SHALL display the promotion dialog with piece images
3. WHEN a pawn reaches the promotion rank in ComputerChessBoard THEN the system SHALL display the promotion dialog with piece images
4. WHEN the promotion dialog is displayed THEN it SHALL use the same visual design and piece images as existing promotion dialogs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all chess board components to handle promotion consistently, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows the same patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing promotion dialogs THEN each component SHALL use the existing PromotionDialog component
2. WHEN a promotion occurs THEN the component SHALL follow the same state management pattern as ChessTutorialBoard and ChessBattleBoard
3. WHEN promotion is completed THEN the component SHALL properly update the chess engine and board state
4. WHEN promotion is cancelled THEN the component SHALL revert to the previous game state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chess player solving puzzles, I want to be able to promote pawns with a visual dialog, so that I can complete puzzles that require specific promotion choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN solving a puzzle that requires promotion THEN ChessPuzzleBoard SHALL display the promotion dialog
2. WHEN I select a promotion piece THEN the puzzle engine SHALL validate the move and continue puzzle evaluation
3. WHEN the promotion is part of the puzzle solution THEN the system SHALL accept the correct promotion choice
4. WHEN the promotion is incorrect for the puzzle THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a chess player in local multiplayer mode, I want both players to be able to promote pawns with visual dialogs, so that we can complete games that involve pawn promotion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN either player's pawn reaches promotion rank in PersonsChessBoard THEN the system SHALL display the promotion dialog
2. WHEN the current player selects a promotion piece THEN the system SHALL update the board and switch turns
3. WHEN promotion occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain proper turn management
4. WHEN promotion is completed THEN the game state SHALL be updated for both players

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chess player against the computer, I want to promote pawns with visual dialogs while the computer handles its promotions automatically, so that I have control over my promotion choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my pawn reaches promotion rank in ComputerChessBoard THEN the system SHALL display the promotion dialog
2. WHEN the computer's pawn reaches promotion rank THEN the system SHALL automatically promote to queen (or use engine logic)
3. WHEN I complete promotion THEN the computer SHALL be able to respond with its next move
4. WHEN promotion occurs THEN the Stockfish engine integration SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the chess application, I want the promotion dialog integration to preserve all existing functionality, so that current features continue to work without regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding promotion dialogs to new components THEN all existing game logic SHALL continue to function unchanged
2. WHEN promotion dialogs are integrated THEN existing ChessTutorialBoard and ChessBattleBoard promotion functionality SHALL remain intact
3. WHEN new promotion handling is added THEN existing chess engine integrations SHALL not be broken
4. WHEN components are updated THEN all existing props, callbacks, and state management SHALL continue to work
5. WHEN promotion dialogs are added THEN existing styling and visual elements SHALL not be affected
6. WHEN integration is complete THEN all existing tests and functionality SHALL pass without modification
