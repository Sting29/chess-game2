# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a loader on the login page that appears after submitting credentials. The loader should provide visual feedback for server requests without navigating users away from the current page.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a loading indicator on the login page after submitting my credentials, so that I understand my data is being processed without leaving the current page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters login and password and clicks the "Login" button THEN the system SHALL display a loader overlay on the login page
2. WHEN the loader is displayed THEN it SHALL be positioned over or instead of the login form, covering input fields and the button
3. WHEN the server login request completes with an error THEN the system SHALL hide the loader and display an error message, making the login form accessible again
4. WHEN the server login request completes successfully THEN the system SHALL hide the loader and redirect the user to the main application page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system, I want to limit loader usage to specific operations, so that loading indicators are only shown where appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the loader is used in the project THEN it SHALL only be displayed for login and logout processes
2. WHEN the loader appears in any other places in the project (including avatar changes) THEN it SHALL be removed until contextual loader is implemented
3. WHEN implementing loading states THEN the system SHALL use existing LoadingOverlay or ContextualLoader components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want loading indicators to be properly announced and accessible, so that I can understand the system state regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a loader appears THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and live regions
2. WHEN loading state changes THEN the system SHALL announce changes to screen readers
3. WHEN a loader is active THEN the system SHALL ensure proper focus management
4. WHEN using loading components THEN they SHALL support keyboard navigation and high contrast modes
