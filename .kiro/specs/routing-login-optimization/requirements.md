# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on redesigning the routing logic to consolidate authentication handling on a single route. Currently, the application redirects unauthenticated users to "/login" and authenticated users to "/". The goal is to simplify this by having both LoginPage and ChessTutorial components render on the same root path "/" based on the user's authentication status, eliminating the separate "/login" route entirely.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, I want to see the login page when I visit any URL, so that I can authenticate and access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user navigates to "/" THEN the system SHALL display the LoginPage component without the Layout wrapper
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access any protected route (like "/puzzles", "/play", etc.) THEN the system SHALL redirect them to "/" and display the LoginPage component
3. WHEN the LoginPage is displayed on "/" THEN the system SHALL not show the Layout wrapper component
4. WHEN an unauthenticated user bookmarks or directly accesses any protected route THEN the system SHALL redirect to "/" with LoginPage displayed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to see the chess tutorial page when I visit the root URL, so that I can immediately start using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user navigates to "/" THEN the system SHALL display the ChessTutorial component wrapped in the Layout
2. WHEN an authenticated user is on the LoginPage and becomes authenticated THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect them to "/" with ChessTutorial displayed
3. WHEN an authenticated user refreshes the page on "/" THEN the system SHALL maintain their authenticated state and show ChessTutorial

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the routing system to handle authentication state changes smoothly, so that I don't experience jarring redirects or loading states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state changes from unauthenticated to authenticated THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition from LoginPage to ChessTutorial
2. WHEN authentication state changes from authenticated to unauthenticated THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition from any protected page to LoginPage
3. WHEN the application is loading authentication state THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing logic to be simplified and maintainable, so that it's easier to understand and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the routing logic THEN the system SHALL completely remove the "/login" route from the router configuration
2. WHEN implementing the routing logic THEN the system SHALL modify the root "/" route to conditionally render LoginPage or ChessTutorial based on authentication state
3. WHEN implementing the routing logic THEN the system SHALL update the ProtectedRoute component to redirect to "/" instead of "/login"
4. WHEN implementing the routing logic THEN the system SHALL remove the LoginRoute component as it will no longer be needed
5. WHEN implementing the routing logic THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing protected routes functionality without breaking changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remember my authentication state across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL maintain their authentication state if tokens are still valid
2. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to the login state on "/"
3. WHEN authentication tokens are refreshed successfully THEN the system SHALL maintain the user's current page location
