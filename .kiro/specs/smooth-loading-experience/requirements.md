# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chess application currently experiences flickering and jarring loading states during authentication checks and API operations. Users see a brief white screen with "Loading..." text that creates a poor user experience, especially during navigation and settings updates. This feature aims to implement a smooth, non-intrusive loading experience that maintains visual continuity while providing appropriate feedback for different loading scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless navigation without flickering screens, so that I have a smooth and professional experience while using the chess application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application checks authentication status THEN the system SHALL NOT display a white loading screen that interrupts the visual flow
2. WHEN navigating between protected routes THEN the system SHALL maintain visual continuity without showing jarring loading states
3. WHEN the authentication check completes quickly (under 200ms) THEN the system SHALL skip showing any loading indicator
4. IF authentication check takes longer than 200ms THEN the system SHALL show a subtle loading indicator that doesn't replace the entire screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want appropriate loading feedback during API operations, so that I understand when the system is processing my requests without being distracted by intrusive loading screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating user settings (language, chess set, profile) THEN the system SHALL show contextual loading indicators within the relevant UI components
2. WHEN login/logout operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading states appropriate to the login page context
3. WHEN API operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without leaving users in a loading state
4. IF multiple API operations occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL coordinate loading states to prevent conflicting indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remember my authentication state reliably, so that I don't experience unnecessary authentication checks and loading screens on subsequent visits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I return to the application with valid stored credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate me without showing loading screens
2. WHEN my authentication token is still valid THEN the system SHALL skip redundant authentication API calls
3. WHEN my authentication expires THEN the system SHALL handle logout gracefully with appropriate user feedback
4. IF localStorage contains valid authentication data THEN the system SHALL trust it initially and verify in the background

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want loading states that match the application's visual design, so that any necessary loading indicators feel integrated and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading indicators are necessary THEN the system SHALL use the existing Loader.tsx component for consistency
2. WHEN showing loading states THEN the system SHALL display the loader as a centered overlay on top of the current page content
3. WHEN loading indicators appear THEN they SHALL maintain the current page's background and context rather than replacing it with a gradient background screen
4. IF a loading state must be shown THEN it SHALL use the established Loader component positioned centrally over the existing content without changing the page background

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized loading state management system, so that loading behaviors are consistent across the application and easy to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing loading states THEN the system SHALL use a consistent pattern across all components and pages
2. WHEN managing authentication loading THEN the system SHALL separate different types of loading states (initial auth check, API operations, navigation)
3. WHEN components need loading states THEN they SHALL have access to reusable loading components and hooks
4. IF loading logic needs updates THEN changes SHALL be centralized and not require modifications across multiple files
