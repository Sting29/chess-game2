  - Create LoadingProvider component that manages loading states with delay mechanisms
  - Write unit tests for LoadingContext state management and delay functionality
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3_

- [ ] 2. Implement LoadingManager class with smart delay logic

  - Create LoadingManager class with startLoading/stopLoading methods and 200ms delay threshold
  - Implement automatic cleanup and timeout handling for loading states
  - Add Map-based storage for multiple concurrent loading operations
  - Write unit tests for LoadingManager delay logic and cleanup mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Create useLoading custom hook

  - Implement useLoading hook that provides access to LoadingContext methods
  - Add helper methods for checking loading states and managing loading keys
  - Include proper TypeScript typing and error handling
  - Write unit tests for useLoading hook functionality
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 4. Build LoadingOverlay component using existing Loader

  - Create LoadingOverlay component that renders the existing Loader.tsx as a centered overlay
  - Implement backdrop and positioning styles using styled-components
  - Add optional message display and proper z-index layering
  - Write unit tests for LoadingOverlay rendering and positioning
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Enhance settingsSlice with loading keys

  - Add LOADING_KEYS constant object with keys for different operation types
  - Update Redux async thunks to use the new loading system instead of direct loading state
  - Add initialCheckComplete flag to track first authentication check completion
  - Write unit tests for enhanced settingsSlice loading integration
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 6. Update LazyRoute component to use overlay loading

  - Replace LoadingContainer gradient background with transparent overlay approach
  - Modify LazyRoute fallback to show Loader as overlay on top of previous page content
  - Remove full-screen gradient background that causes jarring transitions
  - Write unit tests for LazyRoute overlay loading behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Update AuthGuard component for smooth authentication

  - Integrate AuthGuard with the new loading system for authentication checks
  - Add proper error handling that clears loading states on authentication failures
  - Implement background token validation without showing loading indicators
  - Write unit tests for AuthGuard loading state management
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Integrate LoadingProvider into App component

  - Wrap App component with LoadingProvider to provide loading context
  - Add LoadingOverlay component to App.tsx to display global loading states
  - Ensure proper component hierarchy and context availability
  - Write integration tests for App-level loading state management
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3_

- [ ] 9. Update settings page components with contextual loading

  - Modify SettingsPage to use contextual loading for language updates
  - Add loading states for chess set updates using the new loading system
  - Replace any existing loading indicators with the new LoadingOverlay approach
  - Write unit tests for settings page loading integration
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [ ] 10. Add error handling and cleanup mechanisms

  - Implement automatic loading state cleanup on component unmount
  - Add error handling that properly clears loading states when API operations fail
  - Create timeout mechanisms to prevent infinite loading states
  - Write unit tests for error scenarios and cleanup functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 11. Create integration tests for authentication flow

  - Write integration tests that verify no flickering occurs during initial app load
  - Test navigation between protected routes without loading screen interruptions
  - Verify that quick authentication checks (under 200ms) show no loading indicators
  - Test error scenarios and proper loading state cleanup
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 12. Add performance optimization and final testing
  - Optimize loading state management to minimize re-renders
  - Add performance tests to verify loading delay thresholds work correctly
  - Implement final cleanup and code review for loading system integration
  - Write end-to-end tests for complete user authentication and navigation flows
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.4, 5.4_
