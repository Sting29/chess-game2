# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chess application's test suite is currently failing with multiple issues across different test files. The project has 75 failed tests out of 224 total tests, indicating significant problems with test setup, mocking, and component testing. This feature aims to systematically identify and fix all test failures to ensure a reliable test suite that supports continuous development and maintains code quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all chess engine tests to pass, so that I can confidently develop and modify chess game logic without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ComputerChessBoard tests are run THEN the engine.init() method SHALL be properly mocked and available
2. WHEN chess engine components are tested THEN all engine methods (init, quit, makeMove, etc.) SHALL be properly stubbed
3. WHEN chess board components are rendered in tests THEN they SHALL not throw errors related to missing engine methods
4. WHEN kids mode functionality is tested THEN all threat analysis and hint features SHALL work correctly in test environment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all authentication service tests to pass, so that I can ensure the token refresh and authentication flows work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication flow integration tests are run THEN axios interceptors SHALL be properly mocked
2. WHEN token refresh manager tests are run THEN HTTP client methods SHALL be correctly stubbed
3. WHEN authentication service tests are run THEN all async operations SHALL resolve or reject as expected
4. WHEN circuit breaker functionality is tested THEN date/time operations SHALL work correctly without invalid time values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service layer tests to pass, so that I can maintain confidence in the application's core business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessionExperienceManager tests are run THEN axios module imports SHALL be properly handled
2. WHEN HTTP client tests are run THEN all network request mocking SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN error handler tests are run THEN all error scenarios SHALL be properly tested
4. WHEN service integration tests are run THEN all dependencies SHALL be correctly mocked

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component tests to pass, so that I can ensure UI components render and behave correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React components are tested THEN all required props SHALL be provided
2. WHEN component interactions are tested THEN event handlers SHALL be properly mocked
3. WHEN component rendering is tested THEN all external dependencies SHALL be stubbed
4. WHEN component state changes are tested THEN Redux store interactions SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test configuration to be robust, so that tests run consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN Jest configuration SHALL properly handle ES modules
2. WHEN external libraries are used THEN they SHALL be correctly mocked or transformed
3. WHEN async operations are tested THEN proper cleanup SHALL occur to prevent memory leaks
4. WHEN test utilities are used THEN they SHALL be consistently available across all test files
