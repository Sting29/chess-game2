# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a new type of puzzle in the chess application called "Maze Puzzles" where a chess piece must navigate through a maze following the movement rules of that specific piece. The maze contains walls, exits, and optional checkpoints that must be visited before the exit becomes available.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want to play maze puzzles where I navigate a chess piece through a maze, so that I can practice piece movement patterns in a fun and challenging way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects maze puzzles THEN the system SHALL display a list of available maze puzzles
2. WHEN the user starts a maze puzzle THEN the system SHALL display an 8x8 chessboard with walls, exits, checkpoints, and a single chess piece
3. WHEN the user clicks on their chess piece THEN the system SHALL highlight all valid moves according to chess rules and maze constraints
4. WHEN the user attempts to move to a wall square THEN the system SHALL prevent the move and provide visual feedback
5. WHEN the user moves their piece to a checkpoint THEN the system SHALL remove the checkpoint marker, convert the square to a normal square, and update the checkpoint counter (e.g., from 2 to 1)
6. WHEN all checkpoints are visited THEN the system SHALL activate the exit squares (change visual state from inactive to active)
7. WHEN the user moves their piece to an active exit THEN the system SHALL complete the puzzle and show victory message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want to see my progress and constraints while solving maze puzzles, so that I can track my performance and understand the challenge requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a maze puzzle has checkpoints THEN the system SHALL display a counter showing remaining checkpoints above the board
2. WHEN a maze puzzle has a move limit THEN the system SHALL display a countdown of remaining moves above the board
3. WHEN a maze puzzle has a time limit THEN the system SHALL display a countdown timer above the board
4. WHEN the move limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL end the puzzle with a failure message
5. WHEN the time limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL end the puzzle with a failure message
6. WHEN the player has no legal moves available THEN the system SHALL end the puzzle with a failure message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want maze puzzles to support different chess pieces with their unique movement patterns, so that I can practice with various piece types including pawn promotion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a maze puzzle uses a knight THEN the system SHALL allow the knight to jump over walls but not land on them
2. WHEN a maze puzzle uses a pawn that reaches the opposite end THEN the system SHALL show the standard promotion dialog (queen, rook, bishop, knight)
3. WHEN a pawn is promoted THEN the system SHALL continue the puzzle with the new piece following its movement rules
4. WHEN any piece attempts to move THEN the system SHALL validate moves according to standard chess rules modified for maze constraints
5. WHEN a pawn encounters a checkpoint THEN the system SHALL allow the pawn to occupy that square both by normal forward movement and by diagonal capture-like movement
6. WHEN a maze puzzle starts THEN the system SHALL ensure only the player moves and the player always moves first

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want maze puzzles to be configurable and integrated with the existing puzzle system, so that I can access them easily and have varied challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the puzzle list page loads THEN the system SHALL display a fourth button for maze puzzles
2. WHEN maze puzzles are configured THEN the system SHALL support FEN-like notation for initial positions using: E=exit, C=checkpoint, W=wall, piece notation (e.g., R=white rook), numbers=empty squares
3. WHEN a maze puzzle configuration is created THEN the system SHALL ensure the piece never starts on a checkpoint and the starting square never coincides with an exit square
4. WHEN a maze puzzle is loaded THEN the system SHALL parse the configuration and set up the board accordingly
5. WHEN maze puzzles are accessed THEN the system SHALL show sequential puzzles without difficulty levels
6. WHEN maze puzzle progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL display completion as a percentage (e.g., "completed 48 of 100 = 48%")
7. WHEN maze puzzle progress is updated THEN the system SHALL store progress in Redux state for future API integration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want maze puzzles to have helpful UI features, so that I can solve them more effectively and restart when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playing a maze puzzle THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle button to enable/disable move hints display
2. WHEN playing a maze puzzle THEN the system SHALL provide a "Restart" button to reset the puzzle to initial state
3. WHEN counters are displayed THEN the system SHALL show them above the board in text format (temporary until final design)
4. WHEN walls are displayed THEN the system SHALL show them with "W" markers (temporary until final design)
5. WHEN exits are inactive THEN the system SHALL display them with red "E" markers (temporary until final design)
6. WHEN exits are active THEN the system SHALL display them with normal "E" markers (temporary until final design)
7. WHEN checkpoints are present THEN the system SHALL display them with "C" markers (temporary until final design)
8. WHEN a checkpoint is visited THEN the system SHALL NOT play any sound signal (temporary until final design)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want maze puzzles to support multiple languages, so that I can use the feature in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN maze puzzles are displayed THEN the system SHALL use localization keys for all text content
2. WHEN puzzle titles and descriptions are shown THEN the system SHALL support Russian, English, Hebrew, and Arabic languages
3. WHEN UI elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL use translated text for counters, buttons, and messages
4. WHEN victory or failure messages appear THEN the system SHALL display them in the user's selected language

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want maze puzzles to have a well-defined data structure and technical architecture, so that the feature can be implemented consistently and maintainably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN maze puzzle data is structured THEN the system SHALL use a MazePuzzle interface with fields: id, titleKey, descriptionKey, initialPosition, maxMoves (optional), timeLimit (optional), hintKey
2. WHEN maze puzzles are implemented THEN the system SHALL create a separate MazeEngine component for game logic
3. WHEN maze puzzles are implemented THEN the system SHALL create a separate MazeBoard component for rendering
4. WHEN maze puzzles are implemented THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated Redux slice for maze progress storage
5. WHEN the initial position is formatted THEN the system SHALL use FEN-like notation (e.g., "E6C/WWWW1WWW/8/8/8/2W1W3/WWW1WWW1/R7 w - - 0 1")
6. WHEN maze puzzles integrate with existing systems THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing chessboard library for rendering
