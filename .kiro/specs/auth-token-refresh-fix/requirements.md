# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chess application is experiencing an infinite loop issue with authentication token refresh requests. When tokens expire, the system continuously attempts to refresh them, resulting in hundreds of failed requests and poor user experience. This feature will implement proper token refresh logic with circuit breaker patterns and graceful fallback to logout when refresh tokens are invalid.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle expired tokens gracefully without creating infinite refresh loops, so that I have a smooth authentication experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a token expires THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh it only once per session
2. WHEN a refresh token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL stop attempting refreshes and redirect to login
3. WHEN multiple API calls fail with 401 errors THEN the system SHALL batch refresh attempts instead of creating multiple concurrent requests
4. WHEN a refresh attempt fails THEN the system SHALL clear all stored tokens and redirect to login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be automatically logged out when my session truly expires, so that I'm not stuck in an error loop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refresh token returns 401 "Invalid or expired refresh token" THEN the system SHALL immediately clear localStorage tokens
2. WHEN refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect user to login page
3. WHEN logout API call fails with 401 THEN the system SHALL still clear local tokens and redirect to login
4. WHEN user is redirected to login THEN the system SHALL display appropriate message about session expiration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for authentication issues, so that I can monitor and debug token-related problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN refresh attempts are made THEN the system SHALL track and limit the number of attempts
3. WHEN infinite loops are detected THEN the system SHALL break the loop and log the incident
4. WHEN tokens are cleared THEN the system SHALL log the reason for token cleanup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to prevent multiple simultaneous refresh requests, so that the system doesn't overwhelm the server with duplicate calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a refresh request is in progress THEN subsequent refresh attempts SHALL wait for the current request to complete
2. WHEN multiple API calls receive 401 errors simultaneously THEN only one refresh request SHALL be initiated
3. WHEN a refresh request completes successfully THEN all pending API calls SHALL retry with the new token
4. WHEN a refresh request fails THEN all pending API calls SHALL be rejected and user SHALL be logged out
