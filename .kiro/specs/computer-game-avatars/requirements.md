# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds user and teacher avatars to the computer chess game interface. The avatars will be positioned on either side of the chess board to provide visual representation of the players - the user on the left and the AI teacher on the right. The user avatar will reflect the user's personalized avatar selection from their account settings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my personalized avatar displayed during computer games, so that I feel more connected to the game and have a consistent visual identity across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a computer chess game THEN the system SHALL display the user's selected avatar on the left side of the chess board
2. WHEN the user has not selected a custom avatar THEN the system SHALL display a default user avatar
3. WHEN the user changes their avatar in account settings THEN the system SHALL reflect this change in the computer game interface
4. WHEN the avatar is displayed THEN it SHALL be properly sized and positioned to not interfere with the chess board

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a teacher avatar representing the AI opponent, so that I have a clear visual indication of who I'm playing against and the game feels more engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a computer chess game THEN the system SHALL display a teacher avatar on the right side of the chess board
2. WHEN the teacher avatar is displayed THEN it SHALL be consistent with the existing teacher avatar design used elsewhere in the application
3. WHEN the teacher avatar is displayed THEN it SHALL be properly sized and positioned to not interfere with the chess board
4. WHEN the game is in progress THEN both avatars SHALL remain visible throughout the game session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the avatars to be properly integrated with the existing game layout, so that the interface remains clean and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN avatars are added to the ChessBoardWrapper THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing chess board positioning and functionality
2. WHEN avatars are displayed THEN they SHALL not overlap with game controls, hints, or other UI elements
3. WHEN the game is played on different screen sizes THEN the avatars SHALL be responsive and maintain proper positioning
4. WHEN the game interface loads THEN the avatars SHALL load smoothly without causing layout shifts
