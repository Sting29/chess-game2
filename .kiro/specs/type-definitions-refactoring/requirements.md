# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring TypeScript interface definitions from data files to dedicated type definition files to improve code organization and maintainability. The current `play-with-computer.ts` file contains both data and type definitions, which violates the separation of concerns principle outlined in the project standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript interfaces to be organized in dedicated type files, so that the codebase follows consistent organization standards and improves maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript interfaces are defined in data files THEN they SHALL be moved to appropriate type definition files in the `src/types/` directory
2. WHEN interfaces are moved THEN all import statements in consuming files SHALL be updated to reference the new location
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the original data file SHALL only contain actual data exports
4. WHEN type definitions are moved THEN they SHALL maintain their exact structure and naming

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript imports and exports, so that the type system works correctly after the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interfaces are moved to type files THEN they SHALL be properly exported using named exports
2. WHEN consuming files import these types THEN they SHALL use the correct import paths
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript compilation errors
4. WHEN type definitions are accessed THEN they SHALL be available from their new location

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactoring to follow project standards, so that the code organization is consistent with the established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new type files THEN they SHALL be placed in the `src/types/` directory
2. WHEN naming type files THEN they SHALL follow the existing naming convention (kebab-case with .ts extension)
3. WHEN organizing types THEN they SHALL be grouped logically by domain or feature area
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the directory structure SHALL align with project standards
