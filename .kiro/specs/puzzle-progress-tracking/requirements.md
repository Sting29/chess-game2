# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements progress tracking functionality for puzzle categories in the chess application. When users complete puzzles in categories like "mate-in-one", the system will automatically track their progress using API calls to save and update completion status. The system handles both initial progress creation and updates to existing progress records.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want my puzzle completion progress to be automatically saved when I complete puzzles, so that I can track my learning journey and resume where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes their first puzzle in a category AND no previous progress exists for that category THEN the system SHALL create a new progress record via POST /progress API
2. WHEN creating initial progress THEN the system SHALL include userId, type "tutorial", category name, and completed array with the first puzzle ID
3. WHEN a user accesses a puzzle page like /puzzles/mate-in-one?page=1 THEN the system SHALL check for existing progress in that category
4. WHEN no existing progress is found for a category THEN the system SHALL prepare to create new progress upon first completion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want the system to update my existing progress when I complete new puzzles, so that my completion history is accurately maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a puzzle AND existing progress exists for that category THEN the system SHALL update the progress via PATCH /progress/{id} API
2. WHEN updating existing progress THEN the system SHALL include all previously completed puzzles plus the newly completed puzzle in the completed array
3. WHEN updating progress THEN the system SHALL use the correct progress record ID from the existing progress data
4. WHEN sending PATCH request THEN the system SHALL include type, category, and the complete updated completed array

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want the system to avoid duplicate progress saves when I replay already completed puzzles, so that my progress data remains clean and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a puzzle that is already in their completed array THEN the system SHALL NOT make any API calls
2. WHEN checking if a puzzle is already completed THEN the system SHALL compare the current puzzle ID against the completed array from existing progress
3. WHEN a puzzle is already completed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback that the puzzle was previously completed
4. WHEN determining whether to save progress THEN the system SHALL only proceed if the puzzle ID is not in the existing completed array

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want the progress tracking to work seamlessly across different puzzle categories, so that I can track progress in multiple areas of chess learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any puzzle category page THEN the system SHALL load progress specific to that category
2. WHEN progress exists for one category THEN it SHALL NOT affect progress tracking in other categories
3. WHEN creating or updating progress THEN the system SHALL use the correct category identifier from the URL or page context
4. WHEN switching between categories THEN the system SHALL maintain separate progress tracking for each category

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chess student, I want the system to handle API errors gracefully during progress saving, so that temporary network issues don't disrupt my learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a progress API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry the progress save operation
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL not prevent the user from continuing to solve puzzles
4. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate the response format before processing
5. IF API calls consistently fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior to continue puzzle solving
