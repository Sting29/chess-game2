# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update Content Security Policy in HTML file

  - Modify the CSP meta tag in `public/index.html` to include the external API endpoint
  - Add `http://167.99.40.216:3000` to the `connect-src` directive while preserving existing security restrictions
  - Ensure the CSP format remains valid and properly structured
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Verify CSP configuration and test API connectivity
  - Test that API requests to the external endpoint are no longer blocked by CSP
  - Verify that other CSP directives continue to function as expected
  - Check browser console for any remaining CSP violation errors
  - Confirm that unauthorized external resources are still properly blocked
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.2, 2.3_
