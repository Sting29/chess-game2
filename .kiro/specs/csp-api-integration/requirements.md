# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chess application needs to update its Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration to allow API requests to an external server. Currently, the CSP restricts all connections to 'self', which blocks requests to the configured API endpoint at `http://167.99.40.216:3000`. This update will enable the application to communicate with the external API while maintaining security best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to successfully make API requests to the external server, so that the chess application can access backend services and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application attempts to make an API request to `http://167.99.40.216:3000` THEN the browser SHALL allow the connection without CSP violations
2. WHEN the CSP is updated THEN it SHALL maintain security by only allowing necessary external connections
3. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no CSP-related console errors for legitimate API requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the CSP to remain restrictive for other resources, so that the application maintains its security posture while allowing necessary API access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CSP is updated THEN it SHALL only modify the `connect-src` directive to include the API endpoint
2. WHEN other CSP directives are evaluated THEN they SHALL remain unchanged from their current secure configuration
3. WHEN unauthorized external resources are accessed THEN the CSP SHALL continue to block them

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CSP configuration to be environment-aware, so that different API endpoints can be used for development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CSP is configured THEN it SHALL support the current API endpoint `http://167.99.40.216:3000`
2. WHEN the configuration is reviewed THEN it SHALL be easily modifiable for different environments
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the CSP SHALL work correctly with the configured API endpoint
