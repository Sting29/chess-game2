# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chess application currently uses react-chessboard version 4.7.3 and needs to be upgraded to version 5.2.0 to take advantage of new features, bug fixes, and improved performance. This upgrade involves updating multiple chess board components across the application while maintaining existing functionality and ensuring compatibility with the current chess engines and game logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade react-chessboard to version 5.2.0, so that the application benefits from the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package.json is updated THEN react-chessboard SHALL be set to version 5.2.0
2. WHEN the application builds THEN there SHALL be no compilation errors related to react-chessboard
3. WHEN all chess board components are updated THEN they SHALL use the new v5 API correctly
4. IF there are breaking changes THEN all affected components SHALL be updated to maintain compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all chess board functionality to work exactly as before, so that the upgrade doesn't break any existing game features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playing chess puzzles THEN the ChessPuzzleBoard SHALL function identically to the previous version
2. WHEN playing against the computer THEN the ComputerChessBoard SHALL maintain all existing functionality
3. WHEN playing with another person THEN the PersonsChessBoard SHALL work without any regressions
4. WHEN using chess tutorials THEN the ChessTutorialBoard SHALL display and function correctly
5. WHEN playing chess battles THEN the ChessBattleBoard SHALL maintain all game mechanics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain all custom styling and piece sets, so that the visual appearance of the chess boards remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom pieces are applied THEN they SHALL render correctly with the new version
2. WHEN board styles are applied THEN the customSquareStyles SHALL work as expected
3. WHEN highlighting squares THEN the visual feedback SHALL remain identical
4. IF the v5 API changes styling approaches THEN the code SHALL be updated to achieve the same visual results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage new v5 features where appropriate, so that the application can benefit from improvements without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new v5 features improve performance THEN they SHALL be implemented where beneficial
2. WHEN new v5 features enhance user experience THEN they SHALL be considered for implementation
3. WHEN v5 provides better TypeScript support THEN the types SHALL be updated accordingly
4. IF v5 offers improved animation or interaction features THEN they SHALL be evaluated for integration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing after the upgrade, so that I can be confident all chess functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upgrade is complete THEN all existing unit tests SHALL pass
2. WHEN testing chess board interactions THEN piece movement SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN testing game logic integration THEN chess engines SHALL interact properly with the updated boards
4. WHEN testing visual elements THEN custom pieces and styling SHALL render correctly
