# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the chess puzzle solving experience by adding click-based move functionality and visual move hints to the PuzzleSolver and ChessPuzzleBoard components. Currently, users can only make moves by dragging pieces, but this enhancement will allow them to click on pieces to see possible moves and click on target squares to execute moves, consistent with the interaction patterns already implemented in ChessTutorialBoard and ChessBattleBoard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a puzzle solver, I want to click on chess pieces to see their possible moves highlighted on the board, so that I can better understand my options and plan my strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a chess piece THEN the system SHALL highlight all legal moves for that piece
2. WHEN a user clicks on a piece with no legal moves THEN the system SHALL not show any highlights
3. WHEN a user clicks on an empty square with no piece selected THEN the system SHALL not show any highlights
4. WHEN a user clicks on a different piece while another piece is selected THEN the system SHALL switch the selection to the new piece and show its legal moves

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a puzzle solver, I want to make moves by clicking on highlighted target squares, so that I can play without needing to drag pieces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a highlighted legal move square THEN the system SHALL execute the move from the selected piece to the target square
2. WHEN a user clicks on a non-highlighted square while a piece is selected THEN the system SHALL clear the selection and highlights
3. WHEN a user clicks on the same selected piece THEN the system SHALL deselect the piece and clear all highlights
4. WHEN a move is executed successfully THEN the system SHALL clear all selections and highlights

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a puzzle solver, I want visual feedback showing which piece is selected and which moves are possible, so that I can clearly see my current selection state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a piece is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected square with a yellow background
2. WHEN legal moves are available THEN the system SHALL show green circular highlights on target squares
3. WHEN a target square contains an opponent piece THEN the system SHALL show a different highlight style indicating a capture move
4. WHEN a target square is empty THEN the system SHALL show a smaller circular highlight indicating a regular move

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a puzzle solver, I want the click-based move functionality to work alongside the existing drag-and-drop functionality, so that I can use whichever interaction method I prefer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a piece THEN the system SHALL continue to work as before with drag-and-drop moves
2. WHEN a user makes a move via clicking THEN the system SHALL provide the same validation and feedback as drag-and-drop moves
3. WHEN a user switches between click and drag interactions THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent state and behavior
4. WHEN an invalid move is attempted via clicking THEN the system SHALL show the same error feedback as drag-and-drop moves

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a puzzle solver, I want the enhanced interaction to respect puzzle-specific constraints, so that I can only make moves that are part of the correct puzzle solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN showing legal moves for a piece THEN the system SHALL only highlight moves that are valid for the current puzzle step
2. WHEN the puzzle has a specific sequence of moves THEN the system SHALL only allow the correct move for the current step
3. WHEN a user clicks on an incorrect move THEN the system SHALL treat it as an invalid move and show appropriate feedback
4. WHEN the puzzle is completed successfully THEN the system SHALL trigger the same completion logic as drag-and-drop moves
