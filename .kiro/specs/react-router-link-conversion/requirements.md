# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on converting all internal navigation from HTML anchor tags (`<a>`) to React Router's `Link` component throughout the chess application. Currently, several components use styled anchor tags with `href` attributes for internal navigation, which causes full page reloads instead of proper single-page application (SPA) navigation. This conversion will ensure consistent routing behavior, preserve application state, and improve user experience by eliminating unnecessary page reloads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user navigating through the chess application, I want internal links to work as SPA navigation, so that the page doesn't reload and my application state is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a puzzle item in the PuzzleList THEN the system SHALL navigate using React Router without causing a page reload
2. WHEN a user clicks on any ChessTutorialButton for internal navigation THEN the system SHALL use React Router Link component instead of anchor tag
3. WHEN internal navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve the current application state and Redux store
4. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL maintain proper history management through React Router

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on the chess application, I want consistent routing patterns across all components, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows React best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing internal navigation THEN the system SHALL use React Router's Link component instead of HTML anchor tags
2. WHEN styled components need navigation functionality THEN the system SHALL use styled(Link) instead of styled.a
3. WHEN passing navigation props THEN the system SHALL use 'to' prop instead of 'href' prop for internal routes
4. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all internal navigation SHALL follow the same pattern as existing properly implemented components (AccountButton, BackButtonImage, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user clicking on puzzle items in the puzzle list, I want to navigate to specific puzzles smoothly, so that I can solve puzzles without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a puzzle item THEN the system SHALL navigate to `/puzzles/${categoryId}/${puzzleId}` using React Router Link
2. WHEN the PuzzleItem component renders THEN the system SHALL use styled(Link) instead of styled.a
3. WHEN the puzzle navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the current authentication state and user preferences
4. WHEN the puzzle page loads THEN the system SHALL not cause a full page reload or lose any application context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user navigating through tutorial sections and game modes, I want smooth transitions between pages, so that my learning experience is not interrupted by page reloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on ChessTutorialButton components THEN the system SHALL navigate using React Router Link
2. WHEN ChessTutorialButton is used in Play, HowToPlay, HowToMove, and PlayWithComputerSelectLevel pages THEN the system SHALL use 'to' prop instead of 'href'
3. WHEN the ChessTutorialButtonWrap component renders THEN the system SHALL use styled(Link) instead of styled.a
4. WHEN navigation occurs through tutorial buttons THEN the system SHALL preserve user progress and application state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the chess application, I want all routing-related code to be consistent and follow React Router best practices, so that future development is easier and bugs are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new navigation components THEN the system SHALL follow the established pattern of using React Router Link
2. WHEN updating existing components THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing prop interfaces where possible
3. WHEN the conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL have no remaining internal navigation using HTML anchor tags
4. WHEN testing navigation THEN all internal routes SHALL work correctly without page reloads
5. WHEN reviewing component props THEN navigation components SHALL accept 'to' prop for internal routes and optionally 'href' for external links
