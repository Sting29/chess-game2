# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification describes the enhancement of the how-to-move tutorial section with visual progress indicators, completion tracking, and improved user experience. The system will display completion status for each chess piece tutorial, provide visual feedback for completed lessons, and enhance navigation with progress-aware features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual indicators on completed chess piece tutorials in the how-to-move section, so that I can easily track my learning progress

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chess piece tutorial is completed THEN the system SHALL display a completion indicator on the tutorial button
2. WHEN the system renders tutorial buttons THEN it SHALL check the progress state for each piece tutorial ID
3. WHEN a tutorial is completed THEN the system SHALL show a green checkmark overlay on the tutorial button
4. WHEN a tutorial is not completed THEN the system SHALL display the button in its normal state without indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my overall progress percentage in the how-to-move section, so that I can understand how much of the tutorial I have completed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the how-to-move page loads THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the completion percentage
2. WHEN calculating progress THEN the system SHALL count completed tutorials divided by total tutorials
3. WHEN displaying progress THEN the system SHALL show the percentage as "X of Y completed (Z%)"
4. WHEN all tutorials are completed THEN the system SHALL display a special "All completed!" message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tutorial buttons to visually indicate their completion status, so that I can quickly identify which pieces I still need to learn

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tutorial button is completed THEN the system SHALL apply a visual completion style (dimmed or with overlay)
2. WHEN a tutorial button is not completed THEN the system SHALL display it with normal highlighting
3. WHEN hovering over a completed tutorial THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip indicating completion
4. WHEN the completion status changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual state immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to reset my progress in the how-to-move section, so that I can start the tutorials over if needed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has completed at least one tutorial THEN the system SHALL display a "Reset Progress" button
2. WHEN the user clicks "Reset Progress" THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
3. WHEN the user confirms reset THEN the system SHALL clear all how-to-move progress from the API and Redux store
4. WHEN progress is reset THEN the system SHALL update all visual indicators to show uncompleted state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see recommended next steps when I complete tutorials, so that I can continue my learning journey effectively

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes their first tutorial THEN the system SHALL suggest the next logical piece to learn
2. WHEN a user completes all basic pieces (pawn, rook, bishop, knight) THEN the system SHALL recommend learning queen moves
3. WHEN a user completes all piece tutorials THEN the system SHALL suggest moving to the how-to-play section
4. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL show them as highlighted buttons or banners

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the progress indicators to integrate seamlessly with the existing progress tracking system, so that the data is consistent across the application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking tutorial completion THEN the system SHALL use the existing progress Redux selectors
2. WHEN a tutorial is completed THEN the system SHALL use the existing progress tracking hooks
3. WHEN displaying progress THEN the system SHALL use the "how-to-move" category from the progress API
4. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL load progress data if not already available

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tutorial section to remember my last accessed tutorial, so that I can easily continue from where I left off

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a specific tutorial THEN the system SHALL store the last accessed tutorial ID
2. WHEN the user returns to the how-to-move main page THEN the system SHALL highlight the last accessed tutorial
3. WHEN no tutorial has been accessed THEN the system SHALL highlight the first uncompleted tutorial
4. WHEN all tutorials are completed THEN the system SHALL not highlight any specific tutorial

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a progress bar or visual indicator showing my overall completion in the how-to-move section, so that I can see my advancement at a glance

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the how-to-move page loads THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar showing completion percentage
2. WHEN tutorials are completed THEN the system SHALL update the progress bar in real-time
3. WHEN the progress bar is full THEN the system SHALL show a completion animation or special styling
4. WHEN displaying the progress bar THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the rest of the application

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access completed tutorials easily for review, so that I can refresh my knowledge of piece movements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tutorial is completed THEN the system SHALL still allow access to the tutorial content
2. WHEN accessing a completed tutorial THEN the system SHALL show a "Review Mode" indicator
3. WHEN in review mode THEN the system SHALL not track completion again
