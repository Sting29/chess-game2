# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the chess application with a backend API using Axios for HTTP requests. The integration focuses on user authentication (login page) and user profile management (settings page), providing secure user session management and profile customization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in to my account using my username and password, so that I can access personalized features and save my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and store the JWT token
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the main application
4. WHEN the API returns a 429 status (too many attempts) THEN the system SHALL display a rate limiting message
5. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL store user information in Redux state
6. WHEN the user closes and reopens the app THEN the system SHALL maintain the login session using stored tokens

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view and update my profile settings, so that I can customize my chess experience and personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL display current profile information
2. WHEN a user updates profile data THEN the system SHALL save changes to the server
3. WHEN profile update is successful THEN the system SHALL update the local Redux state
4. WHEN a user changes language preference THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new language
5. WHEN a user changes chess set preference THEN the system SHALL update the visual chess pieces
6. WHEN a user updates avatar settings THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in the UI
7. WHEN profile update fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my language preferences through the settings page, so that the application interface matches my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens settings THEN the system SHALL display current language selection from API profile
2. WHEN a user selects a new language THEN the system SHALL update both local Redux state and server profile
3. WHEN language is changed THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new language to the interface
4. WHEN language update succeeds THEN the system SHALL sync with i18next configuration
5. WHEN language update fails THEN the system SHALL revert to previous language and show error message
6. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL prioritize API profile language over local storage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my chess set appearance through the settings page, so that I can play with my preferred piece style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens settings THEN the system SHALL display current chess set selection from API profile
2. WHEN a user selects a new chess set THEN the system SHALL update both local Redux state and server profile
3. WHEN chess set is changed THEN the system SHALL immediately update piece visuals in all chess components
4. WHEN chess set update succeeds THEN the system SHALL persist the preference on the server
5. WHEN chess set update fails THEN the system SHALL revert to previous selection and show error message
6. WHEN playing chess THEN the system SHALL use the user's preferred chess set from their profile

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my session to be managed securely, so that my account remains protected and I can manage my active sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it using the refresh token
2. WHEN both tokens are invalid THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to login
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL revoke the current session and clear local storage
4. WHEN API requests fail due to authentication THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh automatically
5. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
6. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL handle network errors gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized API service layer, so that all HTTP requests are consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL use a configured Axios instance
2. WHEN requests require authentication THEN the system SHALL automatically include JWT tokens
3. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL handle them consistently
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide standardized error handling
5. WHEN requests are made THEN the system SHALL include proper headers and configuration
6. WHEN the API base URL changes THEN the system SHALL use a configurable endpoint

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly with the existing internationalization, so that API integration doesn't break the multi-language support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error messages in the user's selected language
2. WHEN user profile language is updated THEN the system SHALL sync with i18next configuration
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL respect the user's saved language preference from the API
4. WHEN language changes THEN the system SHALL update both local state and server profile
